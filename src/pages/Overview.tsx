              Ubuntu Afya is rooted in a belief that every person deserves
              access to quality healthcare, no matter where they live. We are
              the U.S. partner of Afya Research Africa (ARA), a Kenyan
              non-profit that has pioneered community-owned health systems for
              over a decade.

              Together, we strengthen locally led solutions by connecting rural
              families with care through Ubuntu-Afya Kiosks, advancing digital
              health innovation through STONE-HMISÂ®, and equipping health
              workers with evidence and training that improves decision-making.

              Our work is built on collaboration with communities, governments
              and global partners. We exist because we know lasting change comes
              when health systems are owned and sustained by the people they
              serve.
